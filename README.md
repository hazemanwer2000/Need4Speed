## *Need4Speed*
This is an open-source JavaFX (Java 8) solution, controlling any RC vehicle with a serial interface.

The GUI consists of three main components:
* Speed limiter (`Slider`): Limits the maximum speed of the vehicle.
* Lock (`Button`): Limits the maximum speed of the vehicle (ON/OFF).
* Gauge (From the [*Medusa*](https://github.com/HanSolo/medusa) library): Displays the current speed of the vehicle. 

***Notes:***
* The arrow keys control the direction of motion of the vehicle, and are *non-latching*.
* The vehicle constantly accelerates, or decelerates, to its target speed, as long as a key is pressed, and the speed limit has not been reached yet.
* Speed increases gradually, yet velocity (speed and direction) may change in zero-time. For example, when moving forward, then backwards.
